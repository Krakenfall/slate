At this point, "DevOps" might seem like a buzz word to some, but DevOps has real value. DevOps helps smooth over pain points in the [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) of applications and services. It does this by focusing on the what and how. It aims to increase development velocity through improvement in communication, automation of process and reducing [train car syndrome](#train-car-syndrome) (usually by spinning up another track).

I suspect DevOps is what happens when decision-makers finally understand how to use software not only to affect their bottom lines, but also the management of their organizations (and, therefore, their bottom lines).  It's not new; DevOps has essentially been around for decades in one form or another. It's just that now, DevOps is recognizable. Now that it's known industry-wide, everyone is exposed to the idea that you should continuously integrate, universally automate, and talk to each other. Go figure. 

## [](#is-devops-a-job)Is it a job?

Debate rages in the undercurrents of the technical shadows of the internet: Is DevOps a job? It was for me; I held DevOps positions at my first employer for over 3 years. Only having heard of the controversy, I can only speculate on the established sides. I imagine all debates essentially go down like this:

>Question: Is DevOps a job?
>
>DevOps Engineer 1: "*Of course it's a job! It's my job!*"
>
>Software Engineer 1: "*Of course it's not a job! DevOps is a way of doing things, not a career!*"
>
>IT Director 1: "*GET BACK TO WORK*"

I was at .NET Fringe 2017 this year and talked to a software engineer at a large, well-known company who told me just that to my face: DevOps is not a job. I stammered some half answer in response, which I didn't get to finish because we were doing some weird timed social thing that made us switch partners to talk to someone else. But the thing is, I actually agree. DevOps is not a job, it's a way of doing things. Why then, is DevOps Engineer a thing? I've concluded two things:

1. Some executives think DevOps is a fancy term for code-junkie sysadmins. They are mistaken.
2. Some executives realize their company has a major need for changes in the modus operandi, but not all parties are on deck for that change.

One of the key points of DevOps is people over process. You need more than just improved communication in an organization, you need trust. What if that trust doesn't already exist? I realize this still isn't an optimal situation, but where I worked, my boss recognized the need to change how we do things and gave me the power to make those changes. It was awesome. The work I did directly contributed not only to my employer's trust in our development process, production hosting and recovery systems, but also the principles that DevOps represents. These are the same principles that a sufficiently mature company wouldn't have to utter the word "DevOps" to have in their operations. Some companies need a DevOps engineer. At the end of the day, DevOps is something that everyone can do. If you're committed to continuous improvement of communication, process and your company's product, you're doing DevOps too. It's rad.

## [](#definition)Defining DevOps
At the very highest level, I think DevOps is an organizational approach that seeks to break down barriers to code quality, stability and high availability by bridging the communications and technical gap between different teams. This boils down into a few priorities, such as increasing the velocity of code delivery, reducing barriers to communication, reducing the amount of unneeded processes/procedures, and increasing the amount of useful information available to you and your team.

Practically, for a software company, this includes, but is not limited to doing the following:

*   Build a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline for your applications with
    *   Automated, centralized builds
    *   Team code reviews
    *   Robust automated testing
    *   Automated code deployments
    *   Agile/Scrum Planning
*   Automate every technical procedure within reason
    *   If the procedure needs to be done more than once, strongly consider automating it
    *   If the procedure is difficult to automate, figure out why – what part of your stack is causing this pain point? How can it be improved?
*   Create a robust monitoring system for production systems to answer these questions
    *   Is the application/service up?
    *   Is the application/service functional?
    *   Is the application/service healthy?
    *   If the answer is no for any of the above, am I or the right people being notified?
*   Increase communication between teams and foster a culture of continuous improvement and trust
    *   Use team chat apps to provide open and visible communications between and within teams (For example, Slack or TFS Rooms)
    *   Include build and release notifications in a useful way (Team chat webhooks, email (eww, email))
    *   Build a robust documentation store that is visible, accessible and easy to use. Documentation is communication too.
    *   Build bridges between operations/development/business to increase the flow of requirements, timelines, understanding
    *   Identify tools/services that will assist in automating all of the above. Use the best ones.

<small><i>I may update this list as I remember items. This is mostly a list of priorities for a DevOps rollout.</i></small>

If some of this seems hard to do in your organization, don’t forget that DevOps is an approach, a set of principles that lead towards continuous improvement and trust in an organization (and, therefore, better apps/services). DevOps can be applied in small steps and is very worthy goal.

That's all I've got. Thanks for reading and I hope you decide to do some DevOps of your own!

### [](#train-car-syndrome) Train Car Syndrome
I made it up, sorry. It's when all the cars in a train are disconnected so they bounce back and forth, losing momentum. There may be an official name to call this, but I sure as heck couldn't find it on the internet in the 90 seconds I looked. Huh.
