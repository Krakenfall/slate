# What is DevOps?

DevOps is an organizational approach that seeks to break down barriers to code quality, stability and high availability by bridging the communications and technical gap between different teams. This boils down into a few priorities such as increasing the velocity of code delivery, reducing barriers to communication, reducing the amount of unneeded processes/procedures, and increasing the amount of useful information available to you and your team.

Practically, this translates to this for your team:

*   Build a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline for our applications with
    *   Team code reviews,
    *   Automated, centralized builds,
    *   Robust automated testing,
    *   Automated code deployments
*   Automate every technical procedure within reason
    *   If the procedure needs to be done more than once, strongly consider automating it
    *   If the procedure is difficult to automate, figure out why – what part of your stack is causing this pain point? How can it be improved?
*   Create a robust monitoring system for production systems to answer these questions
    *   Is the application/service up?
    *   Is the application/service functional?
    *   Is the application/service healthy?
    *   If the answer is no for any of the above, am I or the right people notified?
*   Increase communication between teams and foster a culture of continuous improvement and trust
    *   Use team chat apps to provide open and visible communications between and within teams (For example, Slack or TFS Rooms)
    *   Include build and release notifications in a useful way (Team chat webhooks, email)
    *   Build a robust documentation store that is visible, accessible and easy to use (documentation is communication too, the wiki format is great)
    *   Build bridges between operations/development/business to increase the flow of requirements, timelines, understanding
    *   Identify tools/services that will assist in automating all of the above and use the best ones

*   If you have PluralSight, there are several great classes on DevOps, including
    *   [Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/continuous-integration-delivery-big-picture)
    *   [Continuous Monitoring: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/continuous-monitoring-big-picture)
    *   [Implementing DevOps in the Real World](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/implementing-devops-real-world)
    
    *Note: If you don’t have PluralSight, highly recommend using or convincing your manager to use your Training budget to get everyone in your team a subscription. It has a ton of great classes on software and best practices.*

If some of this seems hard to do in your organization, don’t forget that DevOps is an approach, a set of principles that lead towards continuous improvement and trust in an organization (and, therefore, better apps/services). DevOps can be applied in small steps and is very worthy goal.
