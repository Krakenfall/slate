# [](#header-1)Welcome

Welcome to my blog! I'm Clinton Barr, a software developer and DevOps advocate. This blog is currently under construction and will soon feature DevOps and software development topics. It will be good!

## [](#header-2)I don't know how to organize this crap

I often ruminate on my failings. Among them is my lack of style and excessive grammatical verbosity! I write too much because I can. Even this is filler until I get around to writing equally inflated content. Feel free to judge.

In the mean time, please enjoy this code sample. Planned future content is also blellow (below, this typo was too awesome to replace).

```js
// For use in philosophical conversation
var meaning = function (isThereAPoint) {
  if (true) {
    return false;
  } else {
    // Just in case trusty if(true) evals to false
    return false;
  }
  // Unreachable code
  return "OH MY GOSH THE WORLD IS BURNING";
}
```

## [](#header-3)Future Content
In no particular order:
* Introducing Continuous Integration to Legacy Applications
* Things I like about PowerShell
* Jenkins vs VSTS vs TravisCI vs TeamCity (scope of post undetermined)
* Chat Bots and When to Use Them
* Increasing Engagement in Online Chats with Bots
* Disaster Recovery: Profess, Propagate and Practice
* DevOps 101: C.A.M.S.
* Developing Monitoring for Production Services
* Demand-Based Dynamic Provisioning

```
The final element.
